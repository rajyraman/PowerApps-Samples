# Blazor web assembly sample

This sample application is based on the code and information provided in [Tutorial: Create an ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly App using Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/walkthrough-blazor-webassembly-single-tenant).

## Demonstrate

1. Uses the Global Discovery Service to obtain your subscribed environments.
1. The `Environment` dropdown will populate environment instances retrieved from the Global Discovery Service.
1. The `Fetch Account` page retrieves accounts entity instances and displays them in a table.

## Add multi-tenancy (optional)

Define your Azure Active Directory (AD) app registration to authenticate with account entity records in any organizational directory - any Azure AD directory (multi-tenant).

## Clean up

No clean-up is required.
