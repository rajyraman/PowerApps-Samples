# Query entity data using the Web API

This sample demonstrates how to define and perform data queries on Common Data Service entity instances using the Web API. The sample solution includes a shared project named CDSWebApiService that provides helper methods for message sending and receiving, performance enhancements, and error processing.

More information: [CDSWebApiService class](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/samples/cdswebapiservice), [Web API Query Data Sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/web-api-query-data-sample)

## How to run the sample

1. Download or clone the sample so that you have a local copy.

1. In the sample's folder, locate the solution file and load it into Visual Studio 2017 or later.

1. In **Solution Explorer** locate and edit the project's App.config file and set appropriate values for the Common Data Service environment you intend to use: connectionString `Url`, `UserPrincipalName`, and `Password`. You only need to perform this step once for all samples that share this file.

1. Press F5 to build and run the program in debug mode.

## Demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how to perform the following queries on entity instance data:

- Selecting specific properties
- Using Query Functions
- Ordering and alias
- Limit results
- Expanding results
- Aggregate results
- FetchXml queries
- Using predefined queries

## Clean up

Prior to termination, the program will display a console prompt asking if you want any created entity records deleted. If you want to view created records after the sample terminates, answer 'n' or 'no' and press \[Enter\].
